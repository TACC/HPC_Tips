To use:

a) Create a MySQL database called HPCTips.  Here at TACC we have a VM which provides the MySQL database.
   a1) Create a user called "tipBuilder" with password "test623" granted all access to HPCTips.
   a2) Create a user called "readerOfTips" with password "tipReader123" with only select privileges.
   a3) Make sure that MySQL DB  can be seen by other hosts of interest.
   a4) "mysql> create database HPCTips;"


b) Modify ./load_tips.py to match database hostname and possibly passwords if you have changed any of the above.

c) Modify approved.tips to match your site.

d) Run ./load_tips.py to fill HPCTips db.  This script is designed to run on the machine that is providing the MySQL db.

e) Modify src/showTip.c to match hostname, password for MySQL DB.

f) Build showTip by:

    $ make

g) Here at TACC we have a module called "tips".  The help section tells users how to get tips and how to disable tips.
   In our case we move the showTip executable to our "/opt/apps/hpc_tips/hpc_tips/bin/showTip".

h) We have our startup scripts source all files in /etc/profile.d/ and the last one (z99_hpc_tips.{sh,csh}) causes the tip to be printed.

      if [ $USER != "root" -a  -n "$PS1" -a -n "$LOGIN_SHELL" -a ! -f ~/.no.tips ]; then
        /opt/apps/hpc_tips/hpc_tips/bin/showTip -w
      fi

   Note that on TACC systems LOGIN_SHELL is set if and only if the shell is a login shell.  Obviously, if a user has a file called ~/.no.tips
   then the command is not run.
